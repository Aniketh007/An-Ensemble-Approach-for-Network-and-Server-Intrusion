# Intrusion-Detection-Deep-Learning
An innovative ensemble model that blends Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for network and server intrusion detection. CNNs excel in spatial feature extraction, particularly suited for analyzing network traffic patterns, while GRUs are adept at capturing temporal dependencies within sequential data.
